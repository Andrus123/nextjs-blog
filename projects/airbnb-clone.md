In order to learn React by building Projects, i build the Airbnb clone with **ReactJS** and **Date Picker API**. Fully deployed in **Firebase** and Mobile-Responsive Design.

And on the Mobile app, i have used **React Native**, with the **CLI**, **API integration** of the Google **Geolocation** API
